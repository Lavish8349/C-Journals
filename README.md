### 🔹 D-1: ASCII Art with `printf()` 🎨💻

This was the day I discovered that `printf()` isn’t just for printing text — it’s for creating art, expressing vibes, and apparently… building weapons 🤠

📁 File: `ascii_shapes_and_gun.c`

🧱 What it draws:
- A **square** ✅
- A **triangle** 🔺
- A **circle** ⭕ (okay, circle-ish 😅)
- A **rectangle** 🧱
- And yes… a whole-ass **gun** 🔫 made entirely out of `*` and chaos

🛠️ Concepts used:
- `printf()` formatting mastery
- ASCII art spacing
- Creative indentation
- No variables, no loops — just **raw character placement energy**

💡 Why it's cool:
- Helps build terminal formatting skills
- Gets you used to how newlines and spacing work
- It’s lowkey satisfying to build something visual with just text

### 🔹 D-2: Typing Speed Judge 🧠💨 (Roast Edition) 

This program judges your typing speed (WPM)... harshly.  
Enter your name, type in your average WPM, and get absolutely flamed or hyped depending on your keyboard skills.

📁 File: `typing_speed_judge.c`

🧠 How it works:
- Input your **name** and **WPM**
- Get a roast or compliment based on your speed:
  - ≤20 WPM → snail slander 🐌
  - 21–60 WPM → “get some reps in”
  - 61–100 WPM → grind mode encouragement
  - 101–150 WPM → borderline menace alert
  - 151–200 WPM → medical warning 😭
  - >200 WPM → `"STOP THE CAP, YOU AIN'T HIM"` 💀

🛠️ Concepts used:
- `scanf()` for user input
- `if-else` logic
- `char[]` strings
- Condition-based humor delivery system™

> _“STOP THE CAP %s, YOU Ain’t HIM.”_

### 🔹 D-1: Origin Story Journal (Hardcoded Edition) 📘💻

A personal storytelling experiment written entirely in C — because why write a diary when you can **compile one**?

📁 File: `lavish_origin_story.c`

🧠 What it does:
Tells the true tale of a commerce student who pivoted into tech, started learning C, and is now chasing his dream CGPA — all through `printf()` lines.

💬 Output highlights:
- Introduces `characterName`, `characterAge`, `universityName`, and `cgpa`
- Prints a motivational arc with line-by-line storytelling
- Includes real-life ambition (pursuing BCA & aiming for 9.0 CGPA)

🛠️ Concepts used:
- String and numeric variables (`char[]`, `int`, `double`)
- `printf()` with format specifiers (`%s`, `%d`, `%.1f`)
- Zero input — just **pure character development**

💡 Why it exists:
- Helps reinforce data types + format printing
- Encourages creativity while learning syntax
- Turns your *real life* into *compilable code*

### 🔹 D-1: Typing Arc – From Snail to Speed Demon ⌨️🔥

This is the second entry in the Lavish Lore™, telling the legendary tale of a young boy who fell in love with typing and **leveled up hard**. It’s short, sweet, and coded entirely in `printf()`.

📁 File: `typing_journey_story.c`

🧠 What it tells:
- A boy named **Lavish**, aged 18
- Obsessed with typing to the point of full-on grind mode
- Progressed from typing on his **phone** to **laptop**
- Went from **20 WPM to 93 WPM** in just **18 days**
- Plot twist? All done on his **first-ever laptop**

🛠️ Concepts used:
- `char[]` for strings
- `int` for age
- `printf()` with `%s` and `%d` formatters
- Sequential storytelling with hardcoded variables

💡 Why it's cool:
- Mixes learning `C` with documenting your real-life hustle
- Shows how small wins (like typing speed) = massive flexes when coded right

### 🔹 D-2: Mad Libs Game – Gym Bro Edition 💪🤣

This is an interactive **Mad Libs-style game** where you fill in random words, and the program spits out a chaotic gym bro story.  
Guaranteed to make your C fundamentals and your imagination both do reps.

📁 File: `madlibs_gymbro.c`

🧠 What it asks for:
- A **body part**
- A **random object**
- An **animal**
- A **place**

🗣️ What it gives you:
A tragic yet hilarious tale of someone going to the gym and absolutely not training what they planned to.

> _"I went to the [place] to train my [body part], but ended up lifting a [object]. Now my [body part] feels like it got attacked by a [wild animal]."_  
> — You, after leg day.

🛠️ Concepts used:
- `char[]` string input
- `scanf()` for user interaction
- `printf()` formatting
- Just enough logic to keep it funny and syntactically correct

### 🔹 D-3: Arrays + Logic Practice 🧠🔢

These projects focus on learning **arrays** and **if-else logic** in C — no loops, no functions, just pure raw control.

📁 Files:
- `typing_scores_min_max_ifelse.c`  
  → Stores 5 typing WPM scores in an array, finds the **highest** and **lowest** using if-else statements only.

- `typing_scores_trend_ifelse.c`  
  → Builds on the first analyzer to detect whether scores are **improving**, **declining**, or **inconsistent**, again using only if-else logic and arrays.

🛠️ Concepts practiced:
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Accessing elements via indices
- Manually tracking `min` and `max` values
- Writing complex `if-else` logic to analyze trends
- Input validation mindset (pre-loops)

⛔ No loops  
⛔ No functions  
✅ Just arrays and raw if-else flow 🔥

⚠️ Warning: May cause chuckles and sudden gym motivation.
