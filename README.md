# 🚀 C Learning Journey – FAANG Roadmap (Day-by-Day)

Welcome to my C programming log — every file in this repo is a small project I built to learn something new and have fun doing it.

---

## 🔹 D-1: Getting Started with C

### 🔸 ASCII Art with `printf()`
📁 `ascii_shapes_and_gun.c`  
Created shapes (square, triangle, circle, rectangle) and a wild ASCII gun using only `printf()`.  
**Concepts:** Text formatting, newline mastery, indentation.

### 🔸 Origin Story (Hardcoded Journal)
📁 `lavish_origin_story.c`  
Wrote my own career shift story in `printf()` lines — from commerce to code.  
**Concepts:** Variables (`char[]`, `int`, `double`), format specifiers.

### 🔸 Typing Glow-Up Story
📁 `typing_journey_story.c`  
Documented how I went from 20 to 93 WPM in 18 days.  
**Concepts:** String handling, storytelling through code.

---

## 🔹 D-2: Logic & Conditionals

### 🔸 Typing Speed Judge (Roast Edition)
📁 `typing_speed_judge.c`  
Roasts or hypes you based on your WPM.  
**Concepts:** `scanf()`, `if-else` chains, basic input/output logic.

### 🔸 Mad Libs – Gym Bro Edition
📁 `madlibs_gymbro.c`  
Generates a funny gym story based on user input.  
**Concepts:** String input via `scanf()`, formatted output.

### 🧠 What I Learned (D-2)
- `if / else if / else` logic  
- Comparison + logical operators  
- Building fun, interactive programs with just logic and text  

---

## 🔹 D-3: Arrays + Raw Logic (No Loops/Functions)

### 🔸 Typing Score Analyzer (Min/Max)
📁 `typing_scores_min_max_ifelse.c`  
Finds the highest and lowest WPM from 5 scores using only `if` statements.  
**Concepts:** Arrays, index access, manual comparison.

### 🔸 Typing Trend Detector
📁 `typing_scores_trend_ifelse.c`  
Checks if scores are improving, declining, or inconsistent.  
**Concepts:** Multi-condition logic, array trend analysis.

📌 **Note:** All D-1 to D-3 files are written without loops or functions — just pure fundamentals.
